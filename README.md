## Game Description
This a dice game where the goal is to have six dies with the same number after repeatedly rolling all or a subset of the dies repeatedly. You roll the six dies and may after each roll chose to hold the face of one or more dies constant and let the others roll.

## Background
This tenzies game was built as part of a React tutorial taken on Scrimba.com and taught by Bob Ziroll.

## Features added:
I added the ability to time the game, record the number of dice rolls and the best result achieved so far in the session.
